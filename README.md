> To get weather information, you must get an open weather API KEY from [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) and set it to [ApplicationConstants.WEATHER_API_KEY](https://github.com/xChivalrouSx/HelperApp/blob/master/HelperApp/Constants/ApplicationConstants.cs) in project.

* Weather can be located each monitors and each corner
* Weather can be moved any location on screen
* Weather can be set as top most or not
